# DEVCON x ICP Smart Contracts Portfolio
## Level 2 Motoko Template

Welcome to your new **Portfolio Template** project, and welcome to the Internet Computer development community! This README serves as an introduction to get you started quickly with your project. 

By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. Feel free to customize the template files and include your own code to speed up your development cycle.

## Getting Started

`In order to use this template make sure that you are using dfx version 0.15.1 for native javascript development framework`

### Walkthrough how to get 0.15.1 using dfx version manager.
`dfxvm install 0.15.1`
`dfxvm default 0.15.1`
`restart your terminal`
`HAPPY CODING`

Before you dive into development, here are some key resources to help you get familiar with the project:

- [Quick Start Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

### Initial Setup

To get started, explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

### Project Setup Commands

Once you're ready to work on your project, here are some commands to help you get started:

```bash
cd portfolio_template/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the Project Locally

To test and run your project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Replica**: This command starts the replica running in the background.
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy the Canisters**: Deploy your canisters to the replica and generate your candid interface.
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

   Once the deployment is complete, your application will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
   ```

3. **Generate a New Candid Interface**: If you make any changes to the backend canister, regenerate the candid interface by running:
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

   This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and it will be automatically run when you execute `dfx deploy`.

---

## Frontend Development

If you're working on the frontend and want to start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend server at:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

API requests will be proxied to the replica at port `4943`.

---

## Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting the frontend code outside of DFX, you may need to make adjustments to ensure that the project doesnâ€™t fetch the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack.
- Use your own method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations:
  - Set `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` to a string in `dfx.json`.
  - Write your own `createActor` constructor for more advanced setups.

---

## Summary

You're now ready to start working with the **Portfolio Template** project. Customize it, build your canisters, and have fun developing on the Internet Computer. If you run into any issues or need help, feel free to check the [official documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs).

Happy coding! ðŸš€
